# Phase 2 + 3 Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Vite + React frontend working locally
- ✅ Mock data loading from JSON files
- ✅ Docker Compose with Redis Stack configured
- ✅ Redis and Composio packages installed

## Architecture Challenge

**Issue**: The current app is a **pure frontend Vite + React app**, not a Next.js app with backend API routes.

**Limitation**: Redis cannot run in the browser. We need a backend server to:
- Connect to Redis
- Run Redis Streams consumers (workers)
- Execute Composio Slack actions
- Maintain persistent connections

## Two Implementation Paths

### Option A: Add Backend API Server (Recommended)
Create a separate Node.js/Express server:
- `server/` directory with Express API
- Redis workers running as background processes
- Frontend calls backend API endpoints
- Full Phase 2 + 3 functionality

### Option B: Frontend-Only with Simulated Workers
Keep frontend-only approach:
- Extend existing mock system
- Add simulated Slack posting (console logs)
- No real Redis Streams or background workers
- Limited to Phase 1 mockup with better simulation

## Recommendation

For a production-ready system, implement **Option A**. However, given the current frontend-only structure, I recommend:

1. **Immediate**: Enhance the existing mock system to simulate Phase 2 + 3 functionality
2. **Future**: Create a backend API server when ready for production

Would you like me to:
- **A)** Create a full backend server with Express + Redis + Composio workers
- **B)** Enhance the frontend mock system to simulate Phase 2 + 3 features
- **C)** Something else?

## What I've Already Done

1. ✅ Updated Docker Compose with Redis Stack
2. ✅ Installed Redis client (node-redis)
3. ✅ Updated src/lib/redis.ts to use node-redis
4. ✅ Created ENV_SETUP.md with environment variable template

## Next Steps Required

Choose your preferred path and I'll implement it accordingly.
