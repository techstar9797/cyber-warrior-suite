# Cyber Warrior Suite - Final Status

## ✅ System Operational - Fresh Start

### What Was Fixed

**1. Detector Agent Tracking**
- ✅ **Fixed:** Detector agent now creates initial "detect" step in Agent Runs
- ✅ **Visible:** Full agent timeline shows Detector → Planner → Executor
- ✅ **Attribution:** Each step shows which agent performed the action

**2. Data Overwhelm Resolved**
- ❌ **Before:** 11,000+ incidents from continuous live feeds
- ✅ **After:** Fresh Redis with only base data (8 incidents)
- ✅ **Approach:** Manual refresh generates 1-2 incidents at a time

**3. Hybrid Ingestor Balance**
- ✅ **Ratio:** 90% synthetic OT/ICS + 10% live threat intelligence
- ✅ **Per Refresh:** 1-2 incidents (not overwhelming)
- ✅ **Variety:** Mix of unauthorized_write, setpoint_tamper, lateral_movement, mqtt_anomaly, malicious_ip

**4. Dashboard Refresh Button**
- ✅ **Overview Page:** Refresh button added
- ✅ **Incidents Page:** Refresh Feed + Reload buttons
- ✅ **Agent Runs Page:** Refresh button with 20-run limit

## Current System State

### Services Running

```
✅ Backend API          (port 3001)
✅ Rules Worker         (Planner agent)
✅ Actions Worker       (Executor agent)
✅ Frontend             (port 8080)
```

### Data Volume (Fresh Start)

```
Incidents:    8 (base seeded data)
Agent Runs:   0 (ready to track)
Assets:       9
Rules:        7
```

### Agent Architecture

**Total Agents: 10**

**Core Pipeline (3):**
1. **Detector** - Identifies threats (multiple variants)
2. **Planner** - Evaluates rules, matches patterns
3. **Executor** - Sends Slack notifications, executes actions

**Detector Variants (7):**
- `agent-detector-ot` 🔍 - Active (synthetic OT/ICS)
- `agent-detector-threatfeed` 🔗 - Available (AbuseIPDB)
- `agent-detector-threatintel` 🔗 - Available (OTX)
- `agent-detector-netflow` 🌐 - Available (dataset)
- `agent-detector-ids` 🛡️ - Available (dataset)
- `agent-detector-suricata` 🛡️ - Available (dataset)
- `agent-detector-iot23` 📡 - Available (dataset)

### Agent Run Timeline (Now Working)

**Step 1: Detection** (Detector Agent)
- Tool: `protocol_analyzer.detect`
- Summary: "Detected {vector} on {asset}"
- Status: Success ✅

**Step 2: Evaluation** (Planner Agent)
- Tool: `rules_engine.evaluate`
- Summary: "Matched X rule(s)"
- Status: Success ✅

**Step 3: Execution** (Executor Agent)
- Tool: `slack.postMessage`
- Summary: "Slack notification sent/simulated"
- Status: Success ✅

## How to Use

### Main Dashboard (http://localhost:8080)

**Refresh Feed Button:**
- Click to generate 1-2 new hybrid incidents
- 90% chance: Synthetic OT/ICS incident
- 10% chance: Live threat intel from AbuseIPDB
- Updates all KPIs automatically

### Incidents Page (http://localhost:8080/incidents)

**Two Buttons:**
- **"Refresh Feed"** - Generate new incidents (1-2 at a time)
- **"Reload"** - Refresh current view from Redis

**Workflow:**
1. Click "Refresh Feed" to add new incidents
2. See new incidents appear at top (sorted by newest)
3. Click any incident to view details
4. Click "Notify in Slack" to trigger agent pipeline

### Agent Runs Page (http://localhost:8080/agent-runs)

**View Agent Activity:**
- Shows most recent 20 agent runs
- Click "Refresh" to reload
- **Timeline now shows:**
  - 🔍 Detector detecting the threat
  - 📋 Planner evaluating rules
  - ⚡ Executor sending Slack notification

**What You'll See:**
```
Run run-abc123
├─ agent-detector-ot (detect)
│  └─ protocol_analyzer.detect → Success
├─ Planner (evaluate)
│  └─ rules_engine.evaluate → Matched 7 rules
└─ Executor (notify)
   └─ slack.postMessage → Simulated
```

## Testing the Full Flow

### Quick Test
```bash
# 1. Open dashboard
open http://localhost:8080

# 2. Click "Refresh Feed" button (top right)
# → Generates 1-2 new incidents

# 3. Navigate to Agent Runs
# → See detector step in timeline

# 4. Navigate to Incidents
# → See new incidents at top
```

### Expected Behavior

**When you click "Refresh Feed":**
1. Backend calls hybrid ingestor
2. 1-2 incidents created with Detector step
3. Events published to `sec:events` stream
4. Rules Worker (Planner) evaluates rules
5. Alerts published to `sec:alerts` stream
6. Actions Worker (Executor) sends Slack notification
7. Agent Run updated with all 3 agent steps
8. Dashboard refreshes with new data

## API Endpoints

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Get incidents (limit 50 by default)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/incidents

# Get agent runs (limit 20)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/agent-runs?limit=20

# Refresh feed (1-2 new incidents)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ingest/refresh
```

## Current Incidents Mix

**Synthetic OT/ICS (90%):**
- unauthorized_write (Critical) - Modbus tampering
- setpoint_tamper (High) - Process control manipulation
- lateral_movement_it_ot (Critical) - IT-to-OT attacks
- mqtt_anomaly (Medium) - IoT protocol issues
- p2p_scan (High) - Network reconnaissance

**Live Threat Intel (10%):**
- malicious_ip (Critical/High) - AbuseIPDB blacklist

## Performance

- ✅ Agent Runs: Limited to 20 (no more hanging)
- ✅ Incidents: Manual refresh (preserves API limits)
- ✅ Fresh Redis: Clean state with base data only
- ✅ Responsive UI: No overwhelming data loads

## What's Working

- ✅ All 3 agent steps visible in timeline
- ✅ Detector attribution working
- ✅ Manual refresh on all pages
- ✅ Hybrid data mix (90/10)
- ✅ 1-2 incidents per refresh
- ✅ Clean history
- ✅ Beautiful UI preserved

## Next Steps

1. Click "Refresh Feed" on dashboard a few times
2. Navigate to Agent Runs to see full timeline
3. Check that Detector agent appears first
4. Verify Planner and Executor steps follow

System ready for presentation! 🚀
